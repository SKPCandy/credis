To build credis-test run: 

  make

to run credis-test type:

  ./credis-test

and hit enter. To perform a simplistic performance benchmark
test. Measuring number of set commands per second, type:

  ./credis-test 10000

where 10000 is the number of set commands to execute. 

Running the benchmark and a redis srver instance locally on 
my machine (old dual-core AMD64 and 2 GB RAM running Debian)
roughly results in 33000 commands/second. Slightly (10-15%) 
faster than the benchmark provided with the redis server.
